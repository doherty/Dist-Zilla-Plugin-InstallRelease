NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InstallRelease - installs your dist after releasing

VERSION
    version 0.004

DESCRIPTION
    After doing "dzil release", this plugin will install your dist so you
    are always the first person to have the latest and greatest version.
    It's like getting first post, only useful.

    To use it, add the following in dist.ini:

        [InstallRelease]

    You can specify an alternate install command:

        [InstallRelease]
        install_command = cpanm .

METHODS
  after_release
    This gets called after the release is completed - it installs the built
    dist using CPAN (unless you specified something different).
